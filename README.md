**Note:** Under development, please contact @tfjmp if you wish to explore this feature further.

**Warning:** due to covid and related extra workload, it has been difficult to support older academic artefacts as much as I would like.
Consequently, libcamquery has fallen behind.
CamFlow [v0.7.1](https://github.com/CamFlow/camflow-dev/blob/master/CHANGES.md#v071) introduced modifications that are incompatible with CamQuery.
The good news: that can be fixed! The bad news: I don't have time to do it at the moment.

In the short term, one can roll-back to a a pre v0.7.1 CamFlow version.

The easiest way to do so is through the [camflow-install repository](https://github.com/CamFlow/camflow-install):
```
git clone https://github.com/CamFlow/camflow-install.git
cd camflow-install
git checkout v0.7.0
make all
```
